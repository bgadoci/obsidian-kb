# Research Workflow

## Research Question
What is the most effective way to conduct and document research in a personal knowledge management system?

## Key Findings
- Progressive summarization helps distill complex information
- Bidirectional linking creates a network of knowledge
- Regular review cycles improve retention and insight generation
- Atomic notes are more versatile than large documents

## Methodology
1. Capture interesting ideas and sources
2. Process notes within 24-48 hours
3. Connect new information to existing knowledge
4. Review and refine periodically

## Data/Evidence
- Personal experimentation with different note-taking methods
- Case studies from knowledge management literature
- Feedback from academic and professional researchers

## Conclusions
A successful research workflow combines:
- Consistent capture methods
- Clear organization systems
- Regular processing habits
- Intentional connection-making

## Open Questions
- How to balance structure vs. flexibility?
- What's the optimal review frequency for different types of information?
- How to measure the effectiveness of a knowledge management system?
