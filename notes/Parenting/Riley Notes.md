Maybe for this weekends lunch if the weather is nice we get food and go to the waterfall and put leaves in the water like old times. 

I'm really struggling today with his being in this spot being somehow my fault. I'm really at War with one side saying you did so much you are the only reason he isn't in worse shape and the other side saying you just didn't do enough because you didn't want to engage with the other dads and didn't work hard enough to plan things where he was around more kids and girls. I went for a walk and had the idea about the lunch above.

Good lunch today. I need more of this intentional 1:1 time with him. He seemed to resonate with it. We need to do it every weekend no matter what. 

What about a new start for Riley? Like we move or we put him in public school? Like he get's a totally new start and can be any version of himself he wants. I feel like I got that when I moved to TX from NY. the hard part for me is that even before I moved I had a friend group that included girls and such and I was going into 8th grade. He's in 10th and just now reaching these problems. I wish I could go back and really pay attention to when he started changing. I remember the club where he didn't like all the people (even though the year before he was fine with it). From there what took the joy from him? His looks? His ears? It's resulted in a kid that can't see himself for what he really is. Full of potential and with all the advantages. Looks. athletic, capable (grades at school are evidenceI, kind, rational, thoughtful, etc. I feel like he's been living in his own world in his own head. Tells us it's fine but it's not. Obviously by what I read. Why does he hide his feelings? I've been next to him his entire life trying to make it ok to share feelings with me. Litreally I was the closes person to him and now he doesn't tell me. It's painful. I love him so so much and only want him to see himself for who I see he is. Who everyone else sees who he is. I'll keep praying.

From my conversation confessing my struggle tonight to Chat-GPT: 

> In the Bible, the light is meant to shine, and you’re right—it’s about him coming to believe that his light is not only there but valuable.

> What you can do is guide him toward small, manageable steps where he can practice sharing his light without overwhelming himself. Just like the biblical analogy of putting the lamp on a stand, he doesn’t have to suddenly leap into the spotlight; he can place his lamp on smaller stands first, learning to grow comfortable in his abilities. Maybe it’s small acts of kindness, engaging more in conversations, or practicing leadership in small group settings.

> It's also important to address his darker thoughts. Sometimes, teens need a safe space to express those emotions without judgment, and reminding him that many great people have struggled with similar feelings can help. If he feels like he’s not enough, he needs assurance that his light is there and it’s okay to let it shine gradually. It doesn’t have to be perfect.

To the above point I need to have him develop a relationship with Bill Strahan. 

This next bit is good: 

> Rather than directly pushing him, it might be about creating opportunities where he can naturally step into roles that let him shine, even if only in small ways at first. Encourage him to lead in low-stakes environments, or allow him to take responsibility in areas where he already shows talent, like when he serves his friends.

And concluding with this: 

> The Bible seems to call both of you to action—your son to trust that his gifts are meant to be shared and you to continue nurturing and guiding him. Proverbs 22:6 says, _“Train up a child in the way he should go; even when he is old he will not depart from it.”_ You’ve laid the foundation for him, and now it’s about patience, encouragement, and helping him take those next steps when he’s ready. It’s not about pushing him too hard but about fostering a space where he feels confident to explore who he is and what he can offer.

The last quote is support for me making upstairs a game room. Need to do it no matter what. Go into debt for it. Create a space for him to invite and rule. I need to get Christy on board with this ASAP. She is conceptually but I mean putting into action. Riley needs to see it right now.

Two things for him today: 1) the reason you are spinning around on this is because you think deeply about purpose and life and that is actually really mature for your age but you don't necessarily have the life experience to answer those questions yet so just getting that experience will help. Kids who don't think this deeply aren't burdoned by this but ultimately may not live as fulfilling of a life 2) Take it a few days at a time, don't worry so much about the rest of your life. Maximize where you are.
