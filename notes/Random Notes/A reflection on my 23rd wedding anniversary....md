As I reflect on 23 years of marriage, a profound realization has settled in: my wife has given her life to me—quite literally. She chose me. She chose to walk this path with me, to journey through life as partners, day in and day out. Every decision she’s made, every argument, every challenge—she chose to continue believing I was the right person for her. And now, I’m finally grasping the weight and beauty of that choice.

For so long, I think I took that for granted without fully understanding what it means for someone to give their life to another. This realization has shifted how I see my role and responsibility within our marriage. It’s not just about being “the one” she chose; it’s about what that choice asks of me. It’s about how I can live in a way that honors the fact that she’s continually choosing me. It makes me want to make better decisions, to be more patient, and to give more of myself in return. I’m not just living my life for me—I’m living it for her too.

But this reflection on my wife’s choice leads me to think about a larger spiritual truth. The concept of someone giving their life for another resonates deeply with the story of Jesus. He laid down His life for us. But, in the same breath, we are called to give our lives to Him. There’s an incredible parallel between giving your life for someone and being given a life for which you are responsible.

In my marriage, my wife gave her life to me, and I now feel the weight of what that means. I feel the call to be worthy of that gift. Similarly, Christ gave His life for me, and I’m called to live in a way that reflects that gift, too. It’s a mutual exchange: as much as we receive, we are also called to give. The more I ponder this, the more I realize that love—whether in marriage or in faith—is not a one-time decision. It’s a series of daily choices, sacrifices, and commitments to live in a way that honors the gift you’ve been given.

So here I am, 23 years in, realizing that my wife’s choice was never just a one-time “yes” at the altar—it’s a lifetime of yeses, a continuous act of love, trust, and belief in me. And now, I choose to live more consciously, more generously, knowing that each day is a new opportunity to say “yes” back to her and to the life we’re building together.
