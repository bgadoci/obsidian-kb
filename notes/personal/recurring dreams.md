## Raw
I do have a recurring dream about this house we live in. Multiple times I've had this dream. There is always some situation leading to us being at this house now that we live in but their is an upstairs area above the roof that is accessed by an outside ladder. Up in there is like a whole "under development" area but it has a big living room and initial kitchen. Beyond that is a series of hallways that lead to lots and lots of other rooms. In this version of this dream there is also some underground area of the house that when you walk into is vast and leads to an exit on the other side. There is like tons of storage space down there. 

There is this other dream that I have that has an upstairs room that is assesible through a closet door or something that opens up to a huge closet with lots of clothes of mine that like I forgot about and in the back of that new closet room is another door that leads to a hallway that is filled with shops of sort and there is a magic component to it. I know when you walk into the initial room it's on the right and opens up to like bookshelves of clothes on the right and a window on the left. The door to the next area is beyond the bookshelves to the right and when walking through that door there is a crosswalk obviuos that we are on an elevated level with a dark store to the front left and lights down the hallway. It's also sorta wet and metal. 

There is this other dream I have where we have like a place in colorado or something that I haven't been to in a while but I realize I left like a whole bunch of clothes there and I find myself back at that place for some reason going through clothes and remember how awesome that they are and deciding what to bring back home. The room I left my clothes in are on the second or third floor at the top of the stairs and there is a dresser straight ahead as you enter the room and the bed is to the left. There is a bathroom on the immediate right and on the other end of the bed, to the left of entering, is a sliding door closet with all my clothes in there and also some other boxes with like personal stuff. 

There is another dream about a house that is at the end of the old thompson street that we ended up having to buy but it has a whole underground area/floor/basement that the sellers didn't know about and when we bought it it was so awesome to find this area. I think I've had dreams where Matt my cousins has come to stay down there for a while. I can see this house being black or dark grey on the outside and on the corner of thompson and that street we turned left on to go to tom thumb. The lighting in the underground area was bright and full of light browns, dark browns and whites. 

There is another dream I have about buying our old house on Crossgate Cir N. And that while keeping my house in richardson I try to start us a life over in that house. It's run down and needs work but the kitchen wall paper is the same color and I cook a meal on the induction stove overlooking the living room with the teal couch and big pioneer projection screen flat TV. 

Another recuring dream is about this house that we end up buying that is white and has a driveway on a culdasac and it is enourmous and some how we live there but we dont' access like any of the house actually. That the opposite end from where you enter there is a theater that still works but isn't used. Inside the kitchen there is a door that looks like a pantry but it opens to stairs down to another theater. Both operational but no one has been there in a while. Inside the front door there is a staircase that goes up and to the right which leads to a second floor hallway with dark green carpet that is lined with rooms. So many not used. The hallway extends way way down and everything beyone this point is abandoned but available which is weird. You pass through a mini kitche on the left side of the hallway with a door to outside right beyond it. In any case I could go on but there is some version of me somewhere that lived in this house. The feeling in this dream is that we have sufch a huge house that we don't use any of it. In recuring later dreams about this place I've gone to the huge theater on the far end (which has a brick facade) and learn that we don't own it anymore. Weird. 

There is this other dream that I used to have that woke me up terrified. I could never explain it but it was just this overwhelming sense of me alone in some darkness and then all of a sudden like a force or feeling came about that was like an unexpected tidal wave that I had to run from at the last minute or this sense of everything going quiet or something like that and it would wake me up with a jolt. This really happened...like enough times for me to concretely remember it being a thing. 

## Cleaned up
I have a recurring dream about a house we live in. I've had this dream multiple times. There is always some situation that leads us to this house. There's an upstairs area, above the roof, accessed by an outside ladder. Up there is an "under development" area, but it includes a big living room and an initial kitchen. Beyond that, a series of hallways lead to many other rooms. In some versions of the dream, there's also an underground area, vast with tons of storage, that leads to an exit on the other side.

Another recurring dream involves an upstairs room accessible through a closet door, which opens up to a huge closet filled with forgotten clothes of mine. At the back of this closet, there's another door leading to a hallway filled with shops, and there's a magical element to it. When you enter the room, there are bookshelves of clothes on the right and a window on the left. The door to the next area is past the bookshelves, and when you walk through, you’re on an elevated crosswalk. Ahead, there’s a dark store to the front left and lights down the hallway. It's sort of wet and metallic.

I also dream about a place, possibly in Colorado, that I haven't been to in a while. I realize I left a whole bunch of clothes there. In the dream, I’m back at this place, going through the clothes and remembering how great they are, deciding which to bring home. The room where I left the clothes is on the second or third floor, at the top of the stairs. As you enter, there's a dresser straight ahead, a bed to the left, and a bathroom immediately to the right. There’s also a sliding-door closet on the other side of the bed with all my clothes and some personal boxes.

In another recurring dream, we buy a house at the end of old Thompson Street. It has an underground area that the previous owners didn’t know about. When we discover it, it’s amazing. In some versions, my cousin Matt comes to stay down there. The house is black or dark grey, sitting at the corner of Thompson and the street we turned left on to go to Tom Thumb. The lighting in the underground area is bright, with light browns, dark browns, and whites.

There’s another dream where I buy our old house on Crossgate Cir N, while still keeping our current home in Richardson. I try to start a new life there. The house is run-down, but the kitchen wallpaper is the same color. I cook a meal on the induction stove, overlooking the living room with the teal couch and big Pioneer projection screen TV.

I also dream about a massive white house on a cul-de-sac, with a driveway. We live there but don’t use most of it. At the opposite end from where we enter, there’s a theater that still works but isn’t used. Inside the kitchen, there’s a door that looks like a pantry, but it opens to stairs leading down to another theater, both functional but abandoned. When you walk in the front door, a staircase goes up and to the right, leading to a hallway lined with rooms, all unused. The hallway extends far, and everything beyond this point feels abandoned but accessible. In later versions of the dream, I go to the huge theater on the far end and learn that we no longer own it. It feels strange.

Another dream I used to have woke me up terrified. It’s hard to explain, but it involved an overwhelming sense of being alone in darkness. Suddenly, a force or feeling would come out of nowhere, like a tidal wave, and I had to run from it at the last minute. Or there was a sudden quiet that would jolt me awake. This happened enough times for me to remember it vividly.
