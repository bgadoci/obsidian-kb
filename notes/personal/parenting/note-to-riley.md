# A Note to Riley

## Summary
Personal reflections on parenting Riley, considering changes in personality and development over time, and questioning parental approaches and their effects.

## Details

### Reflections
I found myself reflecting on whether I could have done more to make life easier for you, especially at this stage. I've been wondering about when exactly things shifted—when you went from being excited and fearless to becoming more shy, more reserved. Somewhere in your youth, something changed, though I can't pinpoint when or why.

It's strange because I can't think of any major environmental factors that would have caused it. By all accounts, things were good. You were privileged in many ways—Mom and I had a solid relationship, and you were surrounded by friends and family. You had a supportive environment, so what happened?

I find myself questioning if I could've done more. Did I get lazy at some point? Did I not challenge you enough when you needed it most? Maybe I should have been more proactive in addressing the moments of doubt, even if it meant having uncomfortable conversations. I feel like I've tried to do that—tried to engage you, push you a little when needed.

### Questions to Consider
- When did the shift in personality occur?
- What environmental factors might have contributed?
- How could I have been more supportive during key developmental stages?
- What approaches might be more effective now?
