# Jokes and Bits

## Summary
Collection of comedy bits, jokes, and humorous ideas for potential performance or creative writing.

## Bits

### Old People's Home
An old persons home or old people in general are like a party you don't want to go to. Like, if you called a friend and said "How's the party" and he was like "It totally sucks over here" and you are like "bet", I'm coming no matter what. Think about it. When you are old you are like "this sucks I wish I was young" but when you are young you don't actually think you'll get old. But then there your young dumbass is getting dragged over your entire life to a shitty party. 

Then like when you are there you are telling everyone "This is the best party" and "These are the Golden Years!", and "It's so cool over here you'll see aging is awesome". But really you are just kinda pissed that you are at this particular lame party but also glad you got invited anywhere.

The metaphor for the last sentence is that you hate that you are at a lame party (being old) and you know you are supposed to pretend it's great being here so you don't look disappointed and weak. You can't look like getting old is getting to you.

### Mom's Wolf

### Elderly Decision-Making

## Development Notes
- Consider A/B testing different punchlines with audiences
- Work on timing for the old people's home bit
- Develop the wolf story with more specific details
- Add personal anecdotes to make bits more relatable
