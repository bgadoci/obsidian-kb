# Bridging the AI Adoption Gap

From Back-Office Tools to Generative AI

Though AI’s roots in the enterprise trace back as far as the 1950s with mainframes and early automation, over the past decade AI was still largely confined to back-office tasks—think payroll automation or inventory management. But fast-forward to November 30, 2022, and the release of ChatGPT marked a turning point. In just two months, 100 million users discovered the power of generative AI, making it the fastest-growing app of all time.

This sudden shift from back-office to front-office AI solutions has taken many organizations by surprise, highlighting a growing divide between AI experimentation and widespread operational integration.

Why does this matter for your business? While ChatGPT and similar tools demonstrate AI’s massive potential, there’s still a substantial gap between experimenting with these solutions and implementing them at scale.
