# Fitpholio update #1

# Fitpholio update #1

I didn't have much time today. My wife went out of town again, so I had work, kid pickup, and an impromptu trip to the orthodontist for my son's broken braces. Despite this, I was able to make some meaningful progress on Fitpholio.

Locally, I finally managed to allow logged-in users to access and edit a settings page, including uploading a profile photo. It may seem simple, but those who have worked with this type of thing before know that it's more complicated than it appears.

As a result, I'm only one view and a few deployment errors away from pushing this to production, which can also be frustrating for those who are familiar with it.

Here's my plan:

1. Deploy to production successfully with no styles

2. Deploy to production with design and messaging

3. Integrate Stripe to charge a ridiculously low price but enough to cover the $100 a month it costs to do this

Deploy to production successfully with no styles

Again, I have no idea if this will be anything significant, but the pursuit is reminding me of what it's like to create, sharpening my skills across design and coding, and keeping me up-to-date on what AI can do.

Stay tuned for more updates.
